Storage refers to a device external to the [[Von Neumann Architecture]] that indefinitely stores data, regardless of power. This includes various types of hardware such as [[Hard Disk Drive]] (HDDs), [[Solid-State Drive]] (SSDs), USB flash drives, and optical discs.
It may be losely referred to as "disk", even though most modern storage media do not actually employ a disk.
