A protocol stack is a layered collection of communication protocols that work together to enable data exchange between devices in a network. Each layer in the stack has a specific function and relies on the layers below it to provide services, creating a structured approach to network communication.

A protocol stack can handle:
* Arbitrary Message Sizes
* Out of order delivery
* Packet Loss
* Bit Errors
* Queueing delays

[[Open Systems Interconnection Model|OSI Model]] is a protocol stack.
